# libft

## Overview
`libft` is a custom library of fundamental C functions built as a learning exercise. It contains reimplementations of standard library functions and additional utilities to facilitate future projects. This repository is structured with a `src` folder containing the implementation files, and a root directory housing the `Makefile` and header files.

## Structure

libft/
├── src/ # Source files (.c)
├── Makefile # Build system for compiling the library
